# BACON Utility

This utility is developed by Cl√©ment Corbin. It is designed to grab Kbart files
from the BAse de COnnaissance Nationale ([BACON](https://bacon.abes.fr/)),
created and maintained by the [ABES](http://www.abes.fr).

Disclaimer: The BACON data is released under CC0 licence. I don't own the data,
neither am I related to the ABES. This program is not developed neither
maintained by the ABES.

This BACON utility relies on the webservices provided by ABES. It allows to user
to submit a list of IDs (ISSN & ISBN) and to automatically retrieve the
associated [KBART](https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/kbart) data.

Additionnally, a little checkbox allows the user to select [OpenEdition](https://www.openedition.org)
data in priority (if any) to support Open Science and easily gain access to free
content!
