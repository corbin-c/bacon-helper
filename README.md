# BACON Utility

This utility is developed by Cl√©ment Corbin. It is designed to grab Kbart files
from the BAse de COnnaissance Nationale ([BACON](https://bacon.abes.fr/)),
created and maintained by the [ABES](http://www.abes.fr).

Disclaimer: The BACON data is released under CC0 licence. I don't own the data,
neither am I related to the ABES. This program is not developed neither
maintained by the ABES.

This BACON utility relies on the [webservices provided by the ABES](http://documentation.abes.fr/aidebacon/index.html#ManuelBacon_1).
User submits a list of IDs (ISSN & ISBN) and automatically retrieves the
associated [KBART](https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/kbart) data.

Additionnally, a little checkbox allows users to select [OpenEdition](https://www.openedition.org)
data in priority (if any) to support Open Science and easily gain access to free
content!

**/!\ If various sources are found for an ID, the helper will prioritize the one
offering Open Access (ie F access type)**

## Using the helper in another context

The JS module called in the web tool can be used for other purposes: it is a
simple BACON webservice wrapper for javascript.

It can be imported with:

```javascript
import { baconIdToKbart } from "https://corbin-c.github.io/bacon-helper/bacon.js"
```

Then, the baconIdToKbart() async function is available. It takes two mandatory
parameters: an array of identifiers and a callback function for showing
progress.

```javascript
  let kbart = await baconIdToKbart(id_array,updateProgress,[openedition]);
```

The resulting kbart object contains two arrays, one being the errors (ie
identifiers which couldn't be resolved) the other being the kbart file lines.
The first line is always returned, even if there are no results. It's the usual
Kbart headers.

The facultative `openedition` argument can take 3 values, 0 for not prioritizing
OpenEdition content, 1 to do so, and 2 to only work with this provider (if an ID
is found elsewhere but not from this provider, it will be excluded). This last
possibility is not shown in the demo.
